# Thirteen - Discord Bot
This Discord bot is a project, programmed in Python, adding new commands as I need them in whatever servers I am in.

The commands that the bot currently have are:
- DnD.Announce
    - Plan to add more DnD commands
- InterestCheck
- Utils:
    - killall
        - Kills all loops
    - logout
        - Makes the bot disconnect and power off

## Requirements ##
In order to run, this bot will need:
- TOKEN = **Discord API Token**
- gcal_token = **Google Calendar API Token**
- people = **Dictionary of** ***names*** **and** ***email addresses***

These should all be put into a **config.py** file in the root directory.
